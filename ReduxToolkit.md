### 🔄 What Are Reducers in Redux?

**Reducers** are **pure functions** that take in the **current state** and an **action**, then return the **new state**.

In simple terms:
> A reducer tells Redux **how to update the state** when something happens (like a button click or API success).

---

### 📦 Basic Reducer Example (without Redux Toolkit)

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

You use it like this:

```js
const newState = counterReducer({ count: 0 }, { type: 'INCREMENT' });
// newState: { count: 1 }
```

---

### 🧠 Key Things to Know about Reducers:

- ✅ They are **pure functions** (no side effects, no API calls inside)
- ✅ They **never mutate the original state** – always return a new object
- ✅ They use the `switch` or `if` to handle different action types

---

### 🛠️ With Redux Toolkit (`createSlice` handles reducers)

```js
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1 },
  }
});
```

Here, `increment` and `decrement` are reducers under the hood. RTK uses **Immer** so you can "mutate" state safely, and it will still create an immutable update.

---

### 🧩 Summary:

| Term        | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `state`     | The current data in Redux store |
| `action`    | An object describing *what happened* (`{ type: 'INCREMENT' }`) |
| `reducer`   | A function that takes `(state, action)` and returns a new state |

Let me know if you want to write your own reducer or connect it in a small project!



Exactly — when you're using **Redux (or Redux Toolkit)**, you **usually don’t need `useState()`** for global or shared state.

---

### 🔍 Why?

- `useState()` is **local** to a component.
- Redux (via **reducers + store**) manages **global state** that can be shared **across any component** in your app.

---

### 📊 When to use what?

| Situation | Use `useState()` | Use Redux (reducers) |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Local UI state (e.g., modal open, form input) | ✅ Yes | ❌ Not needed |
| Global app state (e.g., auth, user, theme, cart) | ❌ Not ideal | ✅ Yes |
| Sharing data between distant components | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy |
| Handling complex state changes | ❌ Gets messy | ✅ Clean with reducers |

---

### ⚙️ Example:

#### ✅ Using `useState()` – Local only
```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

#### ✅ Using Redux (with reducers)
```js
// counterSlice.js
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 },
  }
});
```
Then in your component:
```js
const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
const dispatch = useDispatch();
<button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- `useState()` → for local, simple component states
- **Reducers (via Redux Toolkit)** → for shared, global, or complex app-wide state

You can use both in the same app — just use each where it makes sense.
